# Public module list

We have separate our packages into public / private. All the public modules will be
publish under the `@jsonql`

## @jsonql/event

This is based on our other npm module [nb-event-service](https://npmjs.com/package/nb-event-service) and rewritten
in Typescript. And it will replace the old module gradually.

You should know what it does from the name, [manual here](https://npmjs.com/package/@jsonql/event)

More are coming soon
