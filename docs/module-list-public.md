# Public module list

We have separate our packages into public / private. All the public modules will be
publish under the `@jsonql`

## @jsonql/event

This is based on our other npm module [nb-event-service](https://npmjs.com/package/nb-event-service) and rewritten
in Typescript. And it will replace the old module gradually.

You should know what it does from the name, [manual here](https://npmjs.com/package/@jsonql/event)

This module is not actually require direct installation. All the functionality are integrated into the client side
code. But since we completely rewritten the code base, hence publish it under the `@jsonql` context.

More are coming soon
